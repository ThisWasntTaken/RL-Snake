Development was done on the Anaconda platform. The packages needed are listed in requirements.txt. To install, use
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
inside a new virtual environment.

Files:
------
1. README is this file.
2. requirements.txt contains the list of packages that need to be installed.
3. snake.py contains the environment implementation.
4. snake_simple.py implements the Simple state space and contains code to train it.
5. snake_2d.py implements the 2d state space and contains code to train it.
6. snake_2d_framestack.py implements the 2D Framestack state space and contains code to train it.
7. snake_pixels.py implements the Pixels state space and contains code to train it.
8. snake_pixels_framestack.py implements the Pixels Framestack state space and contains code to train it.
9. agents.py contains the code for the agents---tabular Q learning, vanilla DQN, and double DQN with priority.
10. utils.py contains helper and utility functions.
11. test.py is the file to be run, it contains code to run each trained model on an instance of the environment.
12. report.pdf is the report.
13. models/ is a folder that contains the trained models.

To Run:
-------
```
python test.py
```
This command runs each trained model on an instance of the environment in the order given below:
Simple state space - Tabular Q learning
Simple state space - Vanilla DQN
Simple state space - Double DQN with Priority
2D - Vanilla DQN
2D - Double DQN with Priority
2D Framestack - Double DQN with Priority
